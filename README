shoveserver

Exposes a dictionary-like object via a subset of the memcached protocol.


import shoveserver
somedata = {}
shoveserver.spawn_server(('127.0.0.1', 11211), somedata)
...spawns a new eventlet greenthread and you can go about your business

NOTE:

Despite supporting some write operations the intention is not to produce a
memcached drop-in replacement or for it to be run as a memcached-like server.

However it may have uses within a development environment running as an
easily customiseable memcached-like server.
